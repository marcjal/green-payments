# Green Payments

This project implements a bank system where users can transact money.

### Project setup

If you don't have installed elixir and phoenix. Follow the next links to see how to proceed: [elixir](elixir.md) & [phoenix](phoenix.md)

For those that used asdf I added the .tool-versions file with a pre-defined elixir version to use.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run docker-compose up
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create`
  * Create and migrate your database for test case `MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

  To keep code legible, `mix` comes with a built-in formatter. It is used during development and on CI to check if the developer ran it.
    * mix format
    * mix format --check-formatted --dry-run
  
  To check code consistency, this project uses [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo) as a static code analysis tool and is also used on CI. Credo can be run by the following command.
    * mix credo

  For checking tests coverage, the library `excoveralls` is used. It can be called by running `mix coveralls` (results on console) and `mix coveralls.html` to generate a html page holding results and code points in `./cover/excoveralls.html`.

  Some files were ignored from testing, like phoenix-generated functions and test support functions. The are listed in `coveralls.json`, inside the key `skip_files`.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
